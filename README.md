# streamlit-cdk-fargate
You're one command away from deploying your [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/) app on [AWS Fargate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/userguide/what-is-fargate.html)!

## TLDR: What is that one command you're teasing us with?

`git clone https://github.com/tzaffi/streamlit-cdk-fargate.git && cd streamlit-cdk-fargate && make deploy-streamlit`

### Caveats

Ok, so that was actually assuming the following pre-req's:
* you have an AWS account
* have configured the AWS CLI
* installed AWS CDK on your machine
* have the `git` and `make` commands available
* optional but recommended: `docker` and `docker-compose`

### What if I don't have those pre-reqs?
Here's [an explanation](#pre-requisites)

## Attribution - Standing on the Shoulders of Giants
* Maël Fabien's [excellent post](https://maelfabien.github.io/project/Streamlit/). I ripped off his very trim Streamlit app and Dockerfile.
* Nicolas Metalo's [very comprehensive tutorial](https://github.com/nicolasmetallo/legendary-streamlit-demo). I ripped off most of the rest of this code from there, except that I tried to streamline the CDK stack definition a bit, and summarized the various commands using `make`.


# Ok, that was a little sparse. I want to understand how this all works and what I should do with my streamlit app.
The basic steps are to:

1. [Setup](#setup-your-streamlit-docker-image) your Streamlit Docker image
2. [Test](#test-the-docker-image-locally) the Docker image locally
3. [Setup](#setup-the-cdk-fargate-stack) your CDK streamlit Fargate stack, copying the Docker project into the cdk project
4. [Deploy](#deploy-the-streamlit-docker-on-fargate-using-cdk) the CDK stack
5. Tear-down the CDK stack when you're done using it

## Setup your Streamlit Docker Image
This is the following sub-directory in the repo:
```bash
.
├── streamlit-docker
    ├── Dockerfile
    ├── docker-compose.yml
    |── requirements.txt
    ├── app.py
```

### UPSHOT: Tuck your streamlit `app.py` and `requirements.txt` right next to `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`

You won't need to modify `Dockerfile` or `docker-compose.yml` unless you want do change the configuration, such as running the app on a port different from 8501 (the typical local streamlit port).

## Test the Docker Image Locally

Run the following command:

`cd streamlit-docker && docker-compose up --build streamlit`

You'll be able to run the app locally on port 8501: [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)

## Setup the CDK Fargate Stack
Here you'll use a few command to recreate the cdk portion of this repo and also copy in the docker subdirectory resulting in:
```bash
.
├── cdk
    ├── requirements.txt
    ├── ... a bunch of other autogenerated files you don't have to worry about for this POC ...
    ├── streamlit
    |    ├── streamlit_stack.py
    |    ├── __init__.py
    ├── streamlit-docker
    |    ├── Dockerfile
    |    ├── docker-compose.yml
    |    |── requirements.txt
    |    ├── app.py
```
The commands you will use are:

1. Create the cdk directory and enter it: `mkdir cdk && cd cdk`
2. Create the CDK project skeleton with appropriate virtual env, latest Pip, : 
`cdk init app --language python && python3 -m venv .env && source .env/bin/activate && pip install --upgrade pip && pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Add the project specific CDK Python requirements. In our case these are `aws_ec2`, `aws_ecs`, and `aws_ecs_patterns`:
`aws_cdk.aws_ec2 aws_cdk.aws_ecs aws_cdk.aws_ecs_patterns



## ANTIQUATED - keeping as reminder to add `cdk bootstrap` to make command. - DON'T FORGET TO REMOVE

**I did that, but I got some nasty error about "This stack uses assets..."**

Try `cdk bootstrap` from inside of the `streamlit/` directory. Thent try `cdk deploy` again.


# Deploy the Streamlit Docker on Fargate using CDK

I've now taken the next step and deployed it using [AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/index.html) on [AWS Fargate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/userguide/what-is-fargate.html).

The infrastructure setup on AWS was written 100% using CDK in ***python***. In particular, I **DIDN'T NEED TO TOUCH** any of the of the following:
* AWS GUI
* AWS CLI
* AWS Cloud Formation (thank god I didn't have to mess with that!)

I just had to modify [20 lines of code in one file](https://github.com/CognicalNYC/macgyver/blob/master/cdk/streamlit/streamlit/streamlit_stack.py#L14) - the CDK "stack definition" file that was auto-generated when I initiated the project (`cdk init streamlit`).

After getting the stack definition in place, deploying was as simple as `cdk deploy`. You can see from the resources output at the bottom, that those 20 lines delivered quite a punch. In particular, the following resources were all stood up and configured:
* EC2:
  * VPC
  * Subnet
  * RouteTable
  * SubnetRoutTableAssociation
  * Route
  * NatGateway
  * InternetGateway
  * Cluster
  * SecurityGroup
  * Service
  * ServiceGroup
* ELB
* IAM:
  * Role
  * Policy
* ECS:
  * TaskDefinition
* Logs:
  * LogGroups


## Instructions
0.  Install Node.js as well as CDK (see [macgyver README](https://github.com/CognicalNYC/macgyver/blob/master/README.md#deploying-streamlit-on-fargate-using-aws-cdk) for more details)
1. `git clone git@github.com:CognicalNYC/macgyver.git`
2. The rest is described in the [macgyver README](https://github.com/CognicalNYC/macgyver/blob/master/README.md#deploying-streamlit-on-fargate-using-aws-cdk) but you're a single command away after steps 0. and 1. (`make cdk-deploy PROJECT=streamlit`)
3. Don't forget to clean up when you're all done with either a `make cdk-clean PROJECT=streamlit` or directly inside `cdk/streamlit` with `cdk destoy`

## Deploying Streamlit on Fargate using AWS CDK

A slimmed down version of [nicolasmetallo](https://github.com/nicolasmetallo)'s [comprehensive tutorial](https://github.com/nicolasmetallo/legendary-streamlit-demo)

### **TLDR**

1. Run `make cdk-deploy PROJECT=streamlit`
2. Navigate to the URL printed when the stack is successfully deployed

### What you actually need to do from scratch:

1. [Install node](https://changelog.com/posts/install-node-js-with-homebrew-on-os-x) (CDK's local engine needs it)
2. [Install AWS CDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/work-with.html#work-with-prerequisites) (this is mainly just an `npm install -g aws-cdk`)
3. Initialize the "Streamlit Stack" (e.g. `make cdk-init PROJECT=streamlit` which creates the directory `./cdk/streamlit`)
4. Add CDK dependencies (e.g. `make cdk-install PROJECT=streamlit PACKS="aws_cdk.aws_ec2 aws_cdk.aws_ecs aws_cdk.aws_ecs_patterns"`)
5. Copy the streamlit docker project into the `cdk/streamlit` project (e.g. `cp -r streamlit cdk/streamlit/app`)
6. Modify the stack definition file `cdk/streamilt/streamlit/streamlit_stack.py` - this is really the crux of the "Code as Infrastrucure" definition
7. Deploy the stack to AWS (e.g. `cd cdk/streamlit && cdk deploy`)
8. Navigate to the URL printed when the stack is successfully deployed
9. Don't forget to **CLEAN UP** when you don't need the stack anymore (e.g. `cd cdk/streamlit && cdk destroy`)


## Pre-requisites
* Get an [AWS account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup?nc2=h_ct&src=default&redirect_url=https%3A%2F%2Faws.amazon.com%2Fregistration-confirmation#/start) if you don't already have access to one
* Install the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html) if you haven't already done so and make sure to configure the client to connect with your AWS account (use the command `aws configure` after installation)
* Install the [AWS CDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/getting_started.html) on your machine. NOTE: You'll need to install Node.js as part of the process.
* Install `git` and `make` if you don't already have these on your machine. These will probably be installed if you're using Mac OS or Linux. On windows, you'll have to do a little more work. The last time I was using Windows (circa 2017), I enjoyed the [Chocalatey application](https://chocolatey.org/install) which made installing git and make as simple as running the following commands:
  * `choco install git`
  * `choco install make`
* Optional but highly recommended: For testing locally, you'll also need to install [docker-compose and docker](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
* I'm also assuming that you have Python 3 and Pip installed. Otherwise, why would you have even been interested in this repo?
